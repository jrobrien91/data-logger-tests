# Example:  Increase the measurement and transmission rates when the system is in alarm
"""
Normal mode (not in alarm)

* Measure and log sensor at a normal rate (5 min)
* Transmit at a normal rate of 10 min

If system goes into alarm (based on standard setup), go into fast mode

* Measure and log sensor at a fast rate (30 sec)
* Transmit at a fast rate of 1 min
