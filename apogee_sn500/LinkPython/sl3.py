def lock():
    """
    lock() and unlock() may be used to protect global variables from being corrupted by
    code designed to be run by multiple tasks at the same time. They do this by allowing only
    one task to proceed past the lock() statement at a time. Consider ``Example 1`` where
    a global variable is decremented. Without the lock, two tasks could interfere with each other
    and prevent the global variable from being decremented correctly. Similarly a section of code
    can be protected, such that only one task can enter that code at a time. If you need to protect
    a section of code that's more substantial than some quick operations, consider using
    _thread.allocate_lock() to create a unique lock variable instead, and reserve lock()/unlock()
    for the quick sections.

    Example 1 - Simple lock/unlock::

        from sl3 import lock, unlock
        global my_global
        lock()
        my_global = my_global - 1
        unlock()
            
    Example 2 - Exception safe lock/unlock::

        from sl3 import lock, unlock
        # use try-finally to make sure the global lock is always released
        # even if an exception occurs:
        try:
            lock()
            call_my_function()
        finally:
            unlock()
            
    Example 3 - Exception safe using GLOBAL_LOCK::

        # try-finally is a little cumbersome, here's a simpler way to protect a section of code
        # in an exception-safe way:
        from sl3 import GLOBAL_LOCK
        with GLOBAL_LOCK:
            call_my_function()
            
    Example 4 - Custom lock::

        # in cases where long sections of code must be protected, it's possible to introduce 
        # custom locks to avoid holding up code which use lock()/unlock():
        import _thread
        MY_LOCK = _thread.allocate_lock()

    Notes:
        
    - most Log functions return an instance of the Reading class
    - the current position in the log is tracked on a per thread basis to prevent conflicts
    - it's recommended to avoid creating a Log() instance in a global variable to avoid 
      potential conflict with other threads.

      
    Matching by label and time
        If you want to match certain labels, you can pass it in as the match property; 
        an oldest time or a newest time can be specified as well.
        
        Retrieve the most recent Soft Reset event::
        
            >>> from sl3 import Log
            >>> Log(match='Reset Soft').get_newest()
            05/09/2017,15:06:54,Reset Soft,115,,G
            
        Retrieve the last Soft Reset event that occurred yesterday::
        
            >>> t = localtime()
            >>> # localtime() returns the current time in a tuple which is not-modifiable, but we can
            >>> # convert it into a list and create a unique copy with the list() function:
            >>> t1 = list(t)
            >>> # subtract 1 from the day, and set the HH:MM:SS to 00:00:00
            >>> t1[2:6] = (t1[2] - 1, 00, 00, 00)
            >>> # use the list() function to make another unique copy of the current time:
            >>> t2 = list(t)
            >>> # subtract 1 from the day, and set the HH:MM:SS to 23:59:59
            >>> t2[2:6] = (t2[2] - 1, 23, 59, 59)
            >>> # create a Log() instance with the label we wish to match and the oldest time and newest 
            >>> # time and call get__newest() to start searching for a match moving  backwards in time:
            >>> Log(match='Reset Soft', oldest=mktime(t1), newest=mktime(t2)).get_newest()
            05/08/2017,22:21:16,Reset Soft,115,,G
            
        Retrieve the next earlier matching Soft Reset event::

            >>> Log(match='Reset Soft', oldest=mktime(t1), newest=mktime(t2), pos=LOG_CURRENT).get_older()
            05/08/2017,22:19:58,Reset Soft,114,,G
            
        Or to be more efficient we can copy the Log() instance into a variable and then 
        just re-use it::

            >>> log = Log(match='Reset Soft', oldest=mktime(t1), newest=mktime(t2))
            >>> log.get_older()
            5/08/2017,22:11:54,Reset Soft,113,,G
            >>> log.get_older()
            05/08/2017,17:59:44,Reset Soft,112,,G
        
    Iterating with the Log Class
        If we want to manipulate a block of Log entries in Python, we can take advantage of the fact that 
        the Log() class supports iteration. That means we can loop on it. Here's an example
        that displays the last 2 soft resets that have occured::

            >>> from sl3 import Log
            >>> for reading in Log(2, "Reset Soft"):
            ...     print(reading)
            05/08/2017,22:21:16,Reset Soft,115,,G
            05/08/2017,22:19:58,Reset Soft,114,,G
            
       It's also possible to use a list comprehension to build a list of
       log readings and process them::
       
           # print out the newest 10 stage readings in oldest to newest order
           from sl3 import *
           my_list = [r for r in Log(10, "stage")]
           my_list.reverse()
           for r in my_list:
               print(r)
               
    Search limit
        When searching for a matching label or time in the log, the Log class imposes a limit on
        the number if items that will be scanned called `limit`. This can be changed for all instances
        of the Log class or for just a specific instance. The default is just 1000 and that may not
        be sufficient if you want to search far back in the log. In this first example we will
        change that limit to one million for all future Log searches::
        
            >>> from sl3 import Log
            >>> Log.limit = 1000000
            >>> for reading in Log(5, "Reset Soft"):
            ...     print(reading)
            05/08/2017,22:21:16,Reset Soft,115,,G
            05/08/2017,22:19:58,Reset Soft,114,,G
            05/08/2017,22:11:54,Reset Soft,113,,G
            05/08/2017,17:59:44,Reset Soft,112,,G
            05/08/2017,16:12:37,Reset Soft,111,,G 
            
        Alternatively, the limit can be changed just on an instance of the Log class, leaving 
        the default limit of 1000 items in place::
        
            >>> from sl3 import Log
            >>> my_log = Log(5, "Reset Soft")
            >>> my_log.limit = 1000000
            >>> for reading in my_log:
            ...     print(reading)

    In Python, when you create a global variable, every task, every custom format routine,

    but sometimes separate storage is needed that is unique to the script task, formatter, or 
    measurement That is what the tls() function provides.
        
    Creating a value in thread local storage is done by assigning a name in tls a value:
        tls().daily_rain = 100.0
    
    Referencing a variable stored in thread local storage is just as simple:
        tls().daily_rain = tls().daily_rain + hourly_rain
    
    But how can we tell if a variable already exists so we can tell whether we need to initialize it?
    We can use hasattr().  The code below initializes daily rainfall::
    
        if not hasattr(tls(), "daily_rain"):
            tls().daily_rain = 0.0

    We can also use getattr() to retrieve a value regardless of whether one exists in tls().
    The code below will retrieve a value for slope if one has been stored in tls(), otherwise use 1.0:"::

        slope = getattr(tls(), "slope", 1.0)

    Finally, tls is not limited to simple values. Any data-type that can be assigned to a
